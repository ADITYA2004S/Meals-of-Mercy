# Overview
Meals Of Mercy is a platform designed to bridge the gap between food surplus in restaurants and food scarcity among needy individuals. By facilitating the donation of leftover food from restaurants to those in need, we aim to reduce food waste, alleviate hunger, and promote community well-being.

# Features
**Restaurant Registration**: Restaurants can sign up and list their available surplus food.
**Food Listings**: Detailed listings of available food, including type, quantity, and pick-up times.
**Recipient Access**: Charities, shelters, and individuals can browse and claim listed food items.
**Notifications**: Alerts for new food listings and upcoming food pick-ups.
**Feedback System**: Restaurants and recipients can provide feedback on the donation process.
